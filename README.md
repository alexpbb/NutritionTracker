# NutritionTracker

This is a nutrition tracker web app made to help users track their caloric intake as they strive to reach their goals.
This application provides the user with a personalized system that is geared towards obtaining their goal (Weight gain or loss). 
The basic concept of caloric intake was used to determine the range that the user should be in so that they continue to progress to their goal.

The project utilized Java for the backend development and JavaFx for frontend development. The tracker provides a visual representation of their logged foods and caloric progress throughout the day.
